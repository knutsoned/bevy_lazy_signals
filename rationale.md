# Rationale

Some of the authors of popular reactive frameworks for JavaScript have been participating in an
effort to create a Signal built-in that will provide a common API to support a range of uses.
For Bevy, such a library could help efforts to integrate UI frameworks, enable networking, support
scripting, scene editing, file operations, and so on.

Drawing on many Bevy community discussions, similar projects, and numerous other sources, the
following (non-exhaustive) list of constraints, forces, and goals was assembled:

- Provide a commands-based interface to allow both scheduling signals and triggers, and reading
  values, without needing exclusive world access.
- Fully leverage the ECS to avoid OOP in favor of indexed entites, system queries, and reflection.
- Minimize dependency on other internal Bevy features, except prelude, bevy_ecs, and bevy_reflect.
- Minimize external dependencies (thiserror is probably overkill and could be removed).
- Optimize performance at the cost of roughly doubling some of the data storage via sparse sets.
- Avoid the use of an intrusive global state.
- Since the data and propagator structure is immutable, the reactive mechanics can be simplified.
- Do not allow self-referential computations.
- Do encourage a "one-way data flow" application architecture that relies on immutable values
  within a system, and uses asynchronous updates to merge new values.
- Implement a variation of an immutable propagator network that is glitch-free.
- Avoid macros in favor of relying on reflection, and don't make any new macros.
- Make the function signatures of computed memos and effects be as close to a regular closure as
  possible.

For the purpose of the preceding:

- Immutable means that values can not be set directly but require an asynchronous system to update.
  All updates are applied in a batch and maintain internal integrity outside of the batch process.
- Propagator refers to a data network structure described by Gerald Sussman et al.
- One-way data flow is a signals architecture popular in ECMAScript, essentially a propagator
  network, where values are either atomic, or derived from other atomics, such that there are no
  circular dependencies. Changes to atomic values can be efficiently communicated to the extended
  set of subscribers. Merges (updates) to values are driven by signals (events) which are handled
  asynchronously. These are distinct from and do not use Bevy built-in events.
- Glitch-free means the system is internally consistent at all times outside of its
  internal update cycle.
- Do not taunt Happy Fun Ball(tm).

Being lazy operations on immutable values, the reference implementation should have decent speed.
Because all updates are batched, they can be processed in an efficient way, minimizing the need for
exclusive world access. The consumer of the API provides all static type information at
compile-time, and is responsible for ensuring the concrete types of sources and triggers match up
with the type signatures provided for the closure arguments.

The computed and effect closures require the developer to pass in a heterogeneous tuple of Option<T> which matches the signature of the closure when the computed or effect is spawned. This means when the closure is defined inside the call to spawn the computed or effect, `rust-analyzer` can provide the type information to editor tooling.

Should be able to run systems to send signals and recompute memos as often as needed. If there is
nothing to process, the systems exit quickly. Otherwise, everything but the effects system can run
over and over in between systems that need to send signals and have the next one have the updates
available. The idea is to reduce the need to pepper code with synchronous exclusive world stuff in
the middle of issuing a bunch of commands. The developer is encouraged to design a data structure
that is meant to be read-only in the user code, with updates sent as commands, and applied
asynchronously.
